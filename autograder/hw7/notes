Dockerfile inferred from gradescope output Jnauary 2024.


Autograder requires the following three files

setup.sh          # install linux packages so the testing environment can work
run_autograder    # move files into the right place post-submission
                  # and run python autograder
run_tests.py      # entirely autograder / gradescope boilerplate

Our tests go in 
tests/

There are some other files here:
Dockerfile   # to facilitiate local debugging in the testing environment
Makefile     # glorified shell-script manager
