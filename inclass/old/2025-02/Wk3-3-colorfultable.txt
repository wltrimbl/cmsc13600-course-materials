So I have an enpoint in the samplelibrary app /show_books that outputs an (HTML-formatted!) table with all of the contents of the library card catalog.

The task for today will be to join this table with the inventory table and give us a highlighted table showing which books are checked in and which are checked out.

I make a copy of the library.views.show_books function, and change the name of the table from Books to Inventory, change the field names from author, year, title to id, book, and borrowed.  

What do I need?  
1.  a rule in library.urls.py to handle the show_inventory endpoint
2.  code in library.views.py to retrieve the table
    return render(request, 'show_inventory.html', {'data': Inventory.objects.all()})

3.  an html template in samplelibrary/library/templates/show_inventory.html
4.  Some code in the html template to change the color if the book is not available.  That will look something like this:

    {% if item.borrowed %}
      <font color="red">
    {% endif %}

5.  Some rows in the inventory table, it's kind of sparse right now.
python manage.py runserver
from library.models import Book, Inventory
addInventory('9780446310789',2)  # Add 2 copies of TKAM
from library.models import addInventory
addInventory('9780446310789',2)  # Add 2 copies of TKAM
for book in Inventory.objects.all():
    print(book.id, book.book, book.borrowed)
checkout(9780446310789)
checkout (9781497438095)
