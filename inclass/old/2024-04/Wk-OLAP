Virtualization - using software to provide isolation
	changes costs:
	flexible amount of compute
	portability
	isolation


Suppose attendancechimp got a contract to run the timecard system for a medium-sized state government.
Customers are managers, employees, HR..

Design pattern:  
	separate code and data
	separate high-value data from low-value data
	separate code from configuration

Debuggin pattern:  
	fail early, fail often!

How to characterize a distributed system?
	Consistency
	Availability
	Partition tolerance

CAP theorem:  pick two.
Ordinary circumstances the internet works, and we choose Consistency and Availability, duh.
When the network goes down, we much choose one, consistency or availability.

OLAP  Online analysis processing
	optimized for large, slow, possibly imprecise queries
	complex
	ok if inconsistent or incomplete if informative
	(log analysis, A/B testing)

OLTP Online Transaction processing 
	optimized for small, routine, high-avialability updates
	simple
	fast
	Must Be Consistent.

Compression:  
	Lossless
	models the data
	encodes parameters + difference from model
	because model is good, differences are small & take up less space than the whole dataset
	use short codes for differences that are most probable

	Lossy
	Models the data
	encodes the model
	size(model parameters) we hope is << size(data)
	throw away differences that are inconsistent with model (and presumably less important)


Latency:  time to respons to a single reuqest
Throughput:  number of requests handled per unit time
Bandwidth :  number of bits per second passing through a channel.
	Also synonym for "attention," the thing CS professors claim not to have when blowing you off.
