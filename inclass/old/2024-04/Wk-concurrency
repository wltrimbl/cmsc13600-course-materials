Quote - sometimes server, sometimes os.
When you ask for more resources than permitted, you get cut off.
CPU    Memory    Disk

Concurrency vs. parallelism

Computer runs multiple apps at once  -- how?
What does OS do?
	python manage.py runserver
	OS checks for program python 
	OS checks is it ok to run 
	Load into memory...
	give it the whole ship for a few miliseconds
OS is fundamentally a resource manager, a gatekeeper, enforcing constraints to allow proggrams to run
without interfering with each other.s

Developing attendnacechimp -- what did we do?
	delete the database?
	rm -Rf migrations?
	switch between screens running pytest, runserver, browser?
	add print statements
	wish we could debug line-by-line
	have to debug all the issues that appear when we switch to a different environment (autograder)

resource utilization: what does an enterprise need?
	SQL server
	Webserver
	email
	calendar
	storage
	...

One style of management is to put all these on VMs.

Full virtualization:
Server - hypervisor - multiple VM os's

Containers: ( virtualization lite)
Server - host os - virtualization engine - VM os 


design aesthetic:  one server for code, one to host the data, one for authentication, one for the search engine
pack as many servers onto the same hardware as possible while maintaining required performance

Prinicipal motivation of virtualization was to tuse software to reduce hardware costs...
but portability came as a side benefit.  Dragging your own environment with you 
uses more computing resources, but often fewer human ones for dealing with portability nonsense.
