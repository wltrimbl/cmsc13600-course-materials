# How to get ormlibrary demo working: 

#  Install django.   On OSX, this entails
conda create
conda create --name django
conda activate django
conda install -y  Django pytest cgi 

# This creates a conda virtual environment named 'django' in a directory
# managed by conda, where the ORM framework and all its files will be stored
# separate from your files and from your other applications.


# Next, we have a few magical incantations to create
# django's database, which must be run from the directory containing
# manage.py, namely `cmsc13600-course-materials/ormexamples/ormintro`:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations library
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py migrate library

# Now we can start.  I'll use ipython, a one-line-at-a-time python interpreter
# that has slight enhancements (color, autocomplete) for interactive use.

# In a separate window, I'll open db.sqlite3  with an sqlite client.
# This will let me issue SELECT commands to see what the python is doing.
